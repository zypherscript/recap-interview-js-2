                CSS is the standard style sheet language used on the web. It is a simple, straightforward language that provides basic styling capabilities. CSS allows you to define rules that specify how elements should be displayed, such as colors, fonts, layout, and animations. It uses a selector-based syntax to target HTML elements and apply styles to them.

                Sass, on the other hand, is an extension of CSS that introduces additional features and capabilities. Sass is a preprocessor, which means it must be compiled into CSS before it can be used in a web page. It provides a more advanced and powerful syntax compared to plain CSS.
